        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            I am a PhD student in Computer Science at the University of Colorado - Boulder. I am advised by Professor Qin (Christine) Lv and Professor Morteza Karimzadeh. I have a B.S. in Biomedical Engineering from the University of Texas at Austin, and have completed summer internships at Nokia Bell Labs in Cambridge, UK, Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory, and a startup called Stryd which makes wearable footpods for measuring biomechanics of runners. In addition to my research interests, I am passionate about the Denver Nuggets NBA team, music, ultrarunning on trails, cycling, soccer, and skiing! I am also a big dork and enjoy programming smart WiFi lights to sync up with music, as well as programming applications for my own Garmin watch.
